# MinerU on RunPod Serverless — generic PDF parsing worker.
# MinerU 3.2.x runtime, MinerU2.5-Pro-2605-1.2B VLM as the default model.
#
# Base image: vllm/vllm-openai (recommended by MinerU upstream — bundles CUDA
# + a working vLLM that the VLM backend depends on).
#
# At runtime: handler.py listens for RunPod jobs, downloads/decodes the input
# PDF, calls MinerU's async parse, and returns the result as a base64 tarball.
#
# Model weights are baked into the image at build time (under HF's default
# cache at /root/.cache/huggingface). RunPod's Cached Models
# dashboard feature only supports one model per endpoint, and MinerU needs
# two: the VLM (opendatalab/MinerU2.5-Pro-2605-1.2B) and the pipeline-
# backend model set (opendatalab/PDF-Extract-Kit-1.0). Baking both removes
# the dependency on RunPod's Cached Models setup, the Network Volume, and
# any per-endpoint runtime-download tax. Trade-off: image grows by ~4 GB.

# HF_HUB_OFFLINE=1 + TRANSFORMERS_OFFLINE=1 force the HuggingFace libs to
# read from cache only. Since model weights are baked into the image, the
# cache is always present. Offline mode prevents accidental downloads if
# anything tries to call out at runtime — fail-fast against misconfigured
# endpoints.
#
# Model selection: MinerU 3.2.x's library default is
# `opendatalab/MinerU2.5-Pro-2605-1.2B` for the VLM backend; pipeline
# backend uses `opendatalab/PDF-Extract-Kit-1.0`. Both are baked below.
# Note: MinerU bumps the VLM default on minor-version releases (3.1→3.2
# bumped 2604→2605); the requirements.txt pin is minor-locked to keep
# the baked model in sync with the library default.
