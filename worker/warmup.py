"""Eager warmup at worker boot.

Moves the ~60-100s vLLM + MinerU cold-start tax from first-request
latency to worker-boot latency. The first user request then lands on
a fully warm engine and finishes in ~6 s parse time.

The payoff compounds, but only on hosts the worker has visited
before. FlashBoot is process-snapshot based and **per (host,
image-SHA)** — confirmed empirically 2026-05-26 with a 4-request
investigation (see guides/troubleshooting.mdx "FlashBoot mechanism").
First visit to a host: warmup runs in full (~110 s). Subsequent
scale-from-zeroes that RunPod schedules onto that same host:
snapshot restore in ~7-8 s. New host: warmup re-runs once.

Either way the per-request cold tax is gone — the first user
request always lands on a warm engine. The variable is whether the
*worker boot* paid 110 s or 7 s, which is invisible to the caller's
wall-clock on a snapshot-restored boot.

**Critical asyncio invariant.** vLLM's `AsyncLLMEngine` creates IPC
primitives (transports, queues) bound to the asyncio loop that owned
the warmup call. If that loop is torn down (e.g., via `asyncio.run()`
returning) and a different loop later tries to talk to the engine,
the parent's view of the engine subprocess is dead even though the
subprocess is still running. Symptom: `EngineDeadError` ~75ms into
the first real request.

Production callers MUST use ``warmup_async()`` from inside the same
asyncio loop that will later serve requests. The synchronous
``warmup()`` wrapper exists only for tests / local debug where a
fresh loop per call is fine because tests mock the engine.

Failure is non-fatal. A worker that can't warm up still serves
requests (just slowly on the first one, falling back to lazy load).
This is deliberate: a broken warmup must NOT prevent the worker from
booting and serving traffic.

Logging here uses plain ``print()`` with a ``[mineru-warmup]`` prefix.
This pre-dates the structured JSON logger being loaded, runs in a
distinct lifecycle phase (pre-``serverless.start()``), and remains
visually distinct in RunPod's log viewer from the per-request JSON
records. No need to change it.
